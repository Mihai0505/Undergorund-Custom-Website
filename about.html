		<h2>The dream begins...</h2>

		<br>
		<p>&#9899&nbsp;In 2014 we had a dream, a small workshop for making high end winter equipment.</p>
		<p>&#9899&nbsp;Together with a small team of passionate individuals with world class skills in ski and snowboard competition we started to innovate.</p>
		<p>&#9899&nbsp;After two years of hard work and a lot of learning we had our first products.</p>
		<p>&#9899&nbsp;Our first attempt wasnâ€™t perfect, but we had a strong starting point! In one year we improved our product significantly, gathering reviews from fellow riders and applying them into our vision.</p>
		<p>&#9899&nbsp;At the moment we are working at improving our standard products making them stronger, more playful and better in every way.</p>
		<p>&#9899&nbsp;We are driven by our passion and we encourage anyone who was a dream snowboard or ski to come to us in order to make it real. Our dream of making custom high-end snowboards and skis continues...</p>
